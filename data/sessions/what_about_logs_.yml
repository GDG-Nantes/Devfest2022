abstract: "In this fun, fast-paced talk, Dan puts his sysadmin hat on and takes you on a fun—and hopefully enlightening—journey through a topic that most of us take for granted: **logs**. There’s a good chance you’ve been emitting, collecting, and generally dealing with logs for much of your career (in one form or another).

Really, *what are logs?* Good question. Let’s find out!"
