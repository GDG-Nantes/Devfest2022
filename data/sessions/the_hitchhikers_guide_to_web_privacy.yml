  Hitchhiking isn't really a thing anymore, is it? "The real danger of hitchhiking has most likely remained relatively constant, but the general perception of this danger has increased".

  In the same way, people are increasingly worried about their privacy on the web. Browsers are taking measures to allay these concerns, and the whole landscape is shifting.

  This also impacts us, web developers. What can you do, and what should you do, to improve privacy on your site?

  In this talk, I'll take you on a little trip to answer that question. I'll share concrete tips, things you can do today on your site to improve user privacyâ€”and also user experience, while we're at it.
