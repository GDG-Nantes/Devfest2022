bio: I love science and I love data! After finishing a PhD in genetic engineering, I continued my quest for discovering new patterns through data science and machine learning. I worked for 3 years as ML/Data Engineer and I discovered the world of Developer relations at Microsoft. I now work as a Developer Advocate in AI/ML at AWS and I love sharing my passion with other developers.
