  Passionate about cybersecurity, I like to dive into security aspects of new technologies (Cloud, IoT, Blockchain).
  In the cybersecurity field for 8 years, I work for PayFit as cloud cybersecurity engineer. My job is to design and implement secure solution to protect PayFit client's personnal data and PayFit intellectual property.
