bio: |-
  I'm Olivier, DevRel at OVHCloud. I live in the very west of France, in Brest.

  I started my career at 18, in the Air Force, where for 8 years I was in charge of radar maintenance, then I spent a few years in a computer services company, and my last 15 years have been employed at Crédit Mutuel Arkéa.

  I started as a system administrator (Windows, Unix ♥️), then DBA (Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL, Sybase), then developer (Java, GWT, JEE, etc.), then Automation manager, then DevOps Architect / Evangelist.

  What I prefer is discovering activities, new technologies, trying them out, having fun with them and then sharing them!

  This is valid for my passions, such as improvisation theatre, electronic music production, surfing, poker, bowling, but also for my professional activities!
