  Maud is a developer relations engineer at Chrome for web security and privacy. 

  Before joining Google, Maud was a full-stack developer leaning towards frontend development. She knows first-hand that the concepts needed to build private and secure websites can feel puzzling and obscure‚è§and she's on a mission to change just that.

  Maud lives in Berlin and enjoys windsurfing, baking cookies, and playing the guitar off-key.
