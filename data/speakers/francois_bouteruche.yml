bio: |-
  I'm currently Senior Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services. I am a tech enthusiast with a strong background around .NET development and DevOps philosophy and practices. 

  I have a PhD  in Computer Science. I worked several years around handwriting recognition and pen-based interfaces so I'm very familiar with all the real stuff behind the buzz words AI and Machine Learning :) I led the R&D team at Evodia, the ancestor of [Script and Go](http://www.scriptandgo.com/en) After the fall of Evodia during the 2008-2010 financial crisis, I joined Orange Applications for Business, a subsidiary of Orange, where I focused on Application Lifecycle Management, Agile methodologies and then DevOps practices. I worked at the technical board of the company reporting to the CTO, [Philippe Ensarguet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippeensarguet). After 5 years, I joined [Younited Credit](https://www.younited-credit.com) at the beginning of its scaling stage to help them moving to a public cloud provider (Azure) and setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery best practices.

  Then, I worked 3 year at Microsoft France help .NET Developers from customers, ISV and meetup communities to take the best advantages of Microsoft Developer Tools.

  I've recently joined Amazon Web Services to help .NET Developers using AWS Cloud to build, test and deploy efficiently and securely on AWS Cloud.

  I regularly talk at conferences such as Tech Days, EclipseCon France, API Days, Paris Open Source Summit, Cloud Expo Europe, Breizhcamp, DevFest Nantes, DevFest Strasbourg, Codeurs en Seine...
